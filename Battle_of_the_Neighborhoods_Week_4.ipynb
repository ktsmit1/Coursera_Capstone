        "After returning from the U.S. Marine Corps, Dick Portillo took his savings and investment funds from his brother to purchase a 12-foot trailer (named, \"The Dog House\") and operated it on North Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois as a hot dog stand. By the 1990's, after rebranding to \"Portillo's\", there were 25 stores in the Chicago area.\n",

This location is very popular with both local residents and with tourists to Chicago. \n",
